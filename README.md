Coding Challenge FIND CLOSEST TERMINAL

## Problem :

The new head of Bridge's Operations department is an expert in rail transportation, so he asked the
software development team for a small program that would be able to find the train terminals (with related
information) closest to the loading and unloading point, given as input the geographic coordinates of the
loading location and the unloading location (for the curious, the ideal input would be just the address).
